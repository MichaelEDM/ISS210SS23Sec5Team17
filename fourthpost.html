                        <p>War can have a devastating impact on soldiers, for many veterans, especially those who served in World War I and II, disfigured faces were a common consequence of combat injuries leaving many veterans to live with the social stigma and discrimination that came with visible facial disfigurement.</p>
                        <p>To this day, there are still many individuals who must deal with these awful consequences of war or the work field. However, the rise of plastic surgery has brought new hope to war veterans dealing with disfigured faces.</p>
                        <p>Plastic Surgery revolutionized the field of medicine and laid the foundation for modern reconstructive surgery. These new methods of facial reconstruction allowed war veterans to finally feel welcome in the new world they came home to after war.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">World War 1 Tragedies</h2>
                        <p>World War I was one of the most gruesome conflicts in history, and it brought unimaginable horrors to those who fought in it. One of the most unforgiving effects of the war was the widespread disfigurement of soldiers, who suffered terrible injuries, such as loss of limbs, facial disfigurement, and much more all due to weapons of war. These injuries often left soldiers with devastating effects on their mental health and social lives.</p>
                        <p>Medics in World War I before the adoption of modern plastic surgery techniques, were forced to improvise in order to help these soldiers. Medics would often attempt to reconstruct the faces of these soldiers using methods such as sewing together wounds or other surgical procedures while rushing and without detailed care.</p>

                        <p>However, these procedures were often mangled and ineffective, leaving the soldiers permanently scarred and sometimes unrecognizable. Despite the limitations of medical technology at the time, there were some doctors who were able to make significant improvements in the field of facial reconstruction. One of the most important figures in this field was Sir Harold Gillies.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Rise of PLastic Surgery</h2>
                        <p>The First World War saw a huge increase in the need for facial reconstruction surgery, which paved the way for one of the pioneers of modern plastic surgery, Sir Harold Gillies, a British surgeon who developed many of the techniques that are still used in plastic surgery today. Gillies and his team developed many innovative techniques, including the use of skin grafts, bone reconstruction, and tissue expansion.</p>
                        <p>These new methods of plastic surgery such as bone reconstruction, skin grafts, and tissue expansion that Sir Harold Gillies used during the war, were practiced on over 2,000 patients, which was essential in helping soldiers recover from devastating facial injuries allowing them to regain their appearance and their dignity. Gillies and his team laid the foundation for the field of plastic surgery.</p>
                        <p>After the war, Gillies continued his work in plastic surgery refining his techniques and teaching his knowledge to other doctors across the globe. The development of anesthesia and other medical technologies also helped to make plastic surgery more accessible and safer for patients. This had a significant impact on society, as a viable option for improving their appearance and self-confidence. By the mid 1950â€™s, plastic surgery had become a mainstream medical specialty, and it continues to be an essential field of medicine today.</p>
                        <p>Today, plastic surgery has become more popular than ever before. While many people still view plastic surgery as a way to improve their appearance, it is also used to treat a wide range of medical conditions. These include burns, cleft lip and palate, and congenital deformities using new technologies such as laser surgery, robotic surgery, and 3D printing to make surgery more precise, less invasive, and safer for patients.</p>
