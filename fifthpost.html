                        <p>Disability rights is thankfully receiving more attention in present day society. All around the globe, we are seeing examples of all kinds of rights as countries begin recognizing the true importance of rights for people who have disabilities. </p>
                        <p>There is one fatal flaw. The issue is that although disability rights are now being recognized, we still have yet to fully give a spark to the issue of facial disfigurement. </p>
                        <p>We think it is vital to state that we do know there are laws in place that punish perpetrators for causing facial disfigurement, as well as to protect the victims. However, that is where majority of where the laws end. What happens next to the people who experience facial disfigurement due to a crime? Also, what happens to those who are born with it?</p>
                        <p>Facial disfigurement can cause people to be treated widely different from people who are not facially deformed. One of the things is in medical settings. A doctor may not be as understanding what it is like for a patient who has these facial differences.</p>
                        <p>Although discussed in the other pages of this website, it is crucial to highlight that there needs to be a heavy focus of fixing life with these differences. Depression, anxiety, and body disatisfaction are three common symptoms experienced by people with facial differences.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Ostracized from disability groups</h2>
                        <p>Some people with facial disfigurements do not actually want to consider themselves a part of the disabled community. There are two main reasons. </p>
                        <p>The first reason is that some people in the group do not treat it as a disability. This can cause feelings of not belonging. The second reason is it is still not recognized as an issue enough. What this does is that they have no real need to join such a group. If the group doesn't really recognize that they are too, part of the community of the disabled, then why be in it? There would be no point.</p>
                       
                        <p>With all these factors against them, they are also faced with social stigma. This in turn can create internalized stigma. People who are dealing with internalize stigma can suffer severe consequences.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Awareness is key</h2>
                        <p>Part of the problem that comes with not being recognized is that some laws will not apply to those who are suffering from the disabilities, even if they truly deserve it. This can create a huge assortment of other problems, such as keeping a community hidden. This will in turn make them invisible to having appropriate rights and the ability to live as normal of a life as they can be.</p>

                        <p>Luckily, organizations such as the <a href="https://faceequalityinternational.org/">Face Equality International</a>, who focuses on spreading awareness globally. This is a big step towards strengthening not only the disabled community, but society in general.</p>
                        <p>With true and proper education on not only what facial disfigurement is, but the struggles that are associated with it, will people come to learn that they too have a right to be part of not only the disabled community, but the community of the world.</p>
