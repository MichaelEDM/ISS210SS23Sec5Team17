                        <p>Acid attacks are acts of violence that are aimed at harming, disfiguring, or killing a person. Most common attacks involve the use of either hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. These two acids both have a pH of lower than 2, which makes them strong acids.</p>
                        <p>These attacks can unfortunately happen anywhere in the world, to anyone. These crimes are ones that can happen in an instant. An innocent bystander could randomly have acid poured on them. An acid attack victim can experience different outcomes.</p>
                        <p>The biggest issue when it comes to these acid attacks, is that it is really hard to regulate. The chemicals that are involved are available for purchase by anyone.</p>
                        <p>However, the good news is that there are laws in place that try to prohibit acid attacks, as well as proper punishments for people who commit these crimes.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is life like for the victims?</h2>
                        <p>Depending on the concentration of the chemicals used, as well as the amount of chemicals, acid attacks can vary from mild disfigurement, to severe disfigurement. Sometimes, it can even lead to death.</p>
                        <p>For the victims, it is able to scar their face to the point where cosmetic surgery is not a viable option. Even severe cosmetic surgery can only do so much. The lives of these victims are forever changed.</p>
                        <p>Acid attacks can transform the victims entire life. Not only are they more susceptible to ridicule, but they are also less likely to be hired to certain jobs. While there might be a small "recovery" of facial tissue, the victims usually end up being disfigured. Most oftenly, the face is targeted.</p>
                        <p>The only salvation that victims have is that the perpetrators do usually end up being punished. Specifically, for Pakistan, they have the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act of 2010, which sets a minimum of 14 years imprisonment.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Acid laws</h2>
                        <p>Acid attack prevention laws, such as the one described above, is only scratching the surface when it comes to protecting people and the victims. While we recognize that it is impossible to stop every attack from happening, we must try to prevent it as much as we can. </p>
                        <p>As more of these attacks happen around the world, places such as Pakistan and India are adapting severe measures to combat these issues. With these new laws, there is hope that such punishments will cause perpetrators to second think what they are doing in hopes of them not committing the crime.</p>
                        <p>We say that it is only scratching the surface, because facial disfigurement is not only something that happens temporarily. Usually, it can last a lifetime. This is one of the reasons why we are trying to bring light to such an important issue.</p>
