            <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">

                        <p>\There is a huge psychological burden that comes with having facial disfigurement. Disfigurements such as acne, psoriasis, burns, disformations, cleft lip and palate, and many more affect humans. It has been shown that these imperfections can lead to a lifelong path of mental illness and psychological problems. </p>
                        <p>A lot of more extreme facial disfigurements occur at birth. Meaning that the rest of their life they are not considered “normal” to the common eye. This can lead to children being aggressively bullied, constant staring, and feeling unwelcome in many places. Often children who have grown up like this feel lonely and like they are a disgrace to the world. </p>
                        <p>Some people go their entire life thinking they will never look good enough for the world to accept them. This creates many types of mental illnesses, commonly we see people with a facial disfigurement fall into depression, have social anxiety, and facial/body image issues. </p>
                        <p>In a study published by the National Library of Medicine, they explain that out of “458 adults with a range of visible disfigurements, 48% were judged to have symptoms of an anxiety disorder, and 28% had depression. In a separate study, 56% of patients with facial disfigurement were judged in need of mental health treatment.” This study helps to understand the extremity of mental illnesses in people with facial disfigurements. </p>

                        <p>You can include calls to action or organize your information with subheadings like so or if they are social media accounts, put them in the footer. Just be sure you adjust the title of this heading.</p>
                        <p>This means your heading should not say second heading.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">You may copy or replace this code if you want to quote someone. Four lines of quotation or more (on the page) should be in block quotes, which is why these containers are called block quotes. Not creative but effective.</blockquote>
                        <p>Remember to always unpack a block quote. You should leave the reader remembering your voice, not someone else's.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Real World Experiences</h2>
                        <p>As we know, there are many affected by their disabilities. This video created by 5 NEWS interviews two individuals, Sivaji Arnie and Phil Goff, who live with a form of face disfigurement.
                           They describe their experiences with hate crimes and how these comments and actions by society have affected how they go about their daily life.<p>
