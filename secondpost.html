                        <p>There is a huge psychological burden that comes with having facial disfigurement. Disfigurements such as acne, psoriasis, burns, disformations, cleft lip and palate, and many more affect humans. It has been shown that these imperfections can lead to a lifelong path of mental illness and psychological problems. </p>
                        <p>A lot of the more extreme facial disfigurements occur at birth. Meaning that for the rest of their life, they are not considered “normal” to the common eye. This can lead to children being aggressively bullied, constant staring, and feeling unwelcome in many places. Often children who have grown up like this feel lonely and like they are a disgrace to the world. </p>
                        <p>Some people go their entire life thinking they will never look good enough for the world to accept them. This creates many types of mental illnesses, commonly we see people with a facial disfigurement fall into depression, have social anxiety, and facial/body image issues. </p>
                        <p>In a study published by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468754/#:~:text=In%20a%20study%20of%20458,Strauss%20and%20Broder%2C%201991">National Library of Medicine</a>, they explain that out of “458 adults with a range of visible disfigurements, 48% were judged to have symptoms of an anxiety disorder, and 28% had depression. In a separate study, 56% of patients with facial disfigurement were judged in need of mental health treatment.” This study helps to understand the extremity of mental illnesses in people with facial disfigurements. </p>
                   
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Types of Mental Illnesses linked with Facial Disfigurement </h2>
                        <p> As we previously discussed depression, social anxiety, and facial/body image issues are three main types of mental illnesses linked with facial disfigurement. Depression is the main psychological issue linked to disfigurement. One huge reason for this is the surgeries and/or treatments that are used to reconstruct faces, fix tumors, and more…depressive symptoms are often found post-operation.</p>
                        <p> Depression caused by facial/body image because of facial disfigurement is also very common. The amount of social stressors that are linked with being visibly different have a big impact on psychosocial thoughts of not being “pretty enough” or fitting the social norms. When someone is visibly different it can often be associated with low self-esteem, a bad self-image, fear of rejection, and isolation that can bring someone into a state of major depression. </p>
                       
                        <p>Social anxiety is a disorder that impacts a large sector of the world. The constant fear of being judged, bullied, or humiliating yourself can be consuming in your subconscious, making social settings a lot more difficult. When you add this to having a facial disfigurement, one may find that those affected may have trouble leaving the house, even to do simple task such as grocery shopping or going to the post office. Social anxiety in facial disfigurement can create a very isolated, depressed life for the person affected. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Real World Experiences</h2>
                        <p>Facial Disfigurement affects a large percentage of the world. It is interesting to be able to understand how this affects their daily life and to be able to understand their experiences in our society. The hatred put out into the world can be incredibly shocking and just wrong.</p>
                        <p>This video created by 5 NEWS interviews two individuals, Sivaji Arnie and Phil Goff, who live with a form of face disfigurement.They describe their experiences with hate crimes and how these comments and actions by society have affected how they go about their daily life. https://youtu.be/nYF_AzkqfH0</p>
