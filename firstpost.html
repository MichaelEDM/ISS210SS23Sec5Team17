                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">

                        <p>There is an undeniable stigma surrounding those with facial disfigurements. For childen, this affects how they see themselves, as well as shapes their mindset. Children with facial disfigurments are often mistreated, bullied, and isolated for their differences.
                            Kim, the mother of a young girl named Caitlin who developed facial palsy after having tumor removal surgery, had this to say: 'I took her to her pre-school to have her photo taken and the photographer went, 'what is she doing with her face, that silly face she's pulling?'

"That was the first time I broke down. I cried my eyes out, I had to leave the room and that was the point I realised that nothing was going to be the same again." </p>
                        <p>Facial disfigurement is either a result of a birth defect or physical trauma, both of which are typically unavoidable. Most times, the bullying is too much for children, and leads to antisocial behavior and breakdowns. Most comments made to these children about their appearance are vulgar and overtly negative, causing children with facial disfigurements to have a much different childhood than those with symmetrical faces.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this is not a widely-recognized issue. When parents and children get comments regarding a child's 'silly' or 'messed-up' face, this highlights just how ignorant people are on this issue. Such ignorance leads to misconceptions, stigma, and long-lasting psychological pain for those with a defect.</p>
                        <p>According to the National Library of Medicine, much of the understanding that we have of the psychosocial effects of facial disfigurements come from studies of children, most notably those born with cleft lips or palates. Quote, "In brief, children born with these conditions are at risk for significant psychosocial issues including depression, social anxiety, and reduced quality of life." (National Library of Medicine.) Detailed in this same essay by the NLM, a classic study regarding this issue was with children ages 10-11 who were given 6 types of children to rank from most to least preferred peers. Among the types of children ranked, those who suffered from both obesity and facial disfigurements were ranked the least preferred. Whats more, older children are even less accepting, making it harder on children over time. This is yet another example of the type of discrimination those with disfigurements face, and the stigma that surrounds them. </p>
                        <p>Overall, although facial disfigurement is an often overlooked issue, it is well known just how underrepresented and mistreated people with such a condition are. Typically, only those with a condition are those who mention the issue in an attempt to kickstart a discussion. While the issue of the negative psychosocial effects of a facial disfigurement are slowly being brought to light, we still have far to. How those with facial disfigurements see themselves and live their lives start with what happens in their childhoods. So, if this issue continues to be discussed between people of all levels of ability, we can change how children are treated and pave as bright of a future for them as we do for kids who are born without any defects.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How You Can Help</h2>
                        <p>You can support those with disabilities or facial disfigurements in many ways. The easiest way is to simply treat them as you would anyone else, because they are normal people. Make them feel included, and show kindness. When it comes to raising children, parents can also research how to effectively care for their child based on their disability and needs. Raising them to think positively about themselves and the world around them can help destigmatize disability and allow them to grow up with a childhood or normality, rather than one where they feel isolated and depressed. This will not make everything about their experience easy, but it is a good start in order to propel them into a bright future.</p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"On the other side, we can all learn something more socially useful than, 'It’s rude to stare.'” - Changing Faces.</blockquote>
                        <p>One major way to support someone who has a facial disfigurement is to simply treat them with kindness and to educate yourself on what they're going through. Telling people not to stare at someone with a disability is one thing, but truly educating youreself and understanding the person you find yourself staring at is what is truly important.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Final aspect</h2>
                        <p>Below is a video of speaker Phyllidia Swift speaking on her experience with facial disfigurement. Though not a child, she details how her experience has effected her both mentally and socially since her attack.</p>
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qydFBmtOUEk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
                        <span class="caption text-muted"> Phyllida Swift speaks on her experience with facial disfigurement after a trip to Ghana, and how it has impacted her mindset and social life since. Via YouTube.</span>
                        <p>Phyllidia's video is just one example of how a facial disfigurement can impact one's life. Be it through birth or trauma later in life, a facial disfigurement can severely affect someone's mentality, self-image, and relationships with others.</p>
                        <p>While facial trauma and disfigurement is still widely unexplored and underdiscussed, there is always time to take action. Do some good research, get to know those with facial disfigurements better, and most importantly, realize that people with these experiences are just like you. When we get the ball rolling and really discuss these issues and the problems people with facial trauma experience, we can help change their lives for the better and further the fight for equality for everyone.</p>
